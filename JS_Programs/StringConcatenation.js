// A special property of Strings is that they can be combined or concatenated with one
// another.


var a = "Masai";
let b = "School";
console.log(a+" "+b);

// Note: Notice the circular brackets between num1 + num2 this tells javascript that we
// want to add the two numbers mathematically. Without the brackets the output would be
// 1 + 2 = 12 .
